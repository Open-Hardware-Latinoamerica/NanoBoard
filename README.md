# NanoBoard
 Low cost board for educational robotics applications.
 
## Characteristics
The board has all the necessary hardware to assemble a robot for educational experiences:
- L293 to control two DC motors
- Connector for an HC-SR04 ultrasound distance meter
- Three on-board LEDs
- Three output connectors
- Two input connectors
- Buzzer
- Connector for a HC-05 type Bluetooth module

## Programming
The board can be programmed with any language available for Arduino Nano, although the circuit has been specially adapted to work with the *LOFI Blocks* app, which allows programming using blocks through the Bluetooth connection.
